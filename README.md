# DSPS_cHart

I have never taken a data science class before and I thought it would be interesting, especially when applied to physics. I also don't have a huge amount of coding experience in general, and thought that this would be a good class to gain some experience. 

I want to learn more about how we are going to organize/analyze the data with computers and what relation it has to physics. Neural networks also seem like a cool topic that was brought up in the lecture. 

I've taken a few coding classes here at Delaware. I have some python and C++ knowledge. Mainly, I just want to learn and succeed here though.
