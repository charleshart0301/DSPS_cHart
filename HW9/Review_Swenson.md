**Swenson's review of cHart's HW#9 Plot**

1. Revised plot review:

The updated version of the feature importance plot is much easier to read and interpret compared to the original. In the original plot, the labels were overlapping and rotated, which made it difficult for me to identify which feature corresponded to which bar. The improved layout organizes the labels clearly along the y axis, making the ranking of feature importance much more readable. The updated plot also reduces ambiguity. In the original version, the cluttered labels made it unclear which bars were associated with certain features. In the new version, the spacing and alignment fix this issue and make the meaning of the data more direct.

There is no noticeable distortion introduced in the updated plot. The bar lengths accurately represent the values, and the ordering makes interpretation more intuitive. Distraction is also significantly reduced. The original plot’s overlapping text and squished layout made it visually overwhelming. The new version has a clean format that directs attention to the actual information which proved helpful.

Looking at Tufte’s rules, the improved plot performs *alot* better. The data-ink ratio increases because unnecessary overlapping text and formatting noise were removed. There is no chart junk, and the layout focuses on the actual data instead of stylistic clutter. The number of visual elements aligns with the dimensions of the data, avoiding redundancy. While small multiples are not used here (and not needed), the updated plot respects the idea of simplifying the visual presentation.
Also, the color choice is simple and consistent, which avoids confusion. There are no problematic gradients or color-blind hurdles either!

2. Other comments (bad plot, etc.):

After taking a look at cHart's selection for the "bad" plot, I would have to agree with him. The plot is definitely visually interesting (colorful with a unique layout), though it lacks clarity. I completely agree with cHart's comments and that it is impossible to simply read off this graph being the time axis is represented by length. Given it is not explicity quantified, the importance of the plot is lost.
