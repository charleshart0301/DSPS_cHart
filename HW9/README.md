For this HW, I chose to remake the feature importance plot for the random forest from the Higgs Boson HW. The first thing I changed was the dimensions of the image. 
Before, it took up the entire code cell, but not it is much more clear and maneagable. 
Another change I implemented was to clear up the labels on the y-axis. Before, they were very cluttered and overlapping with each other so much so to the point
where a few of them were just unreadable. 
The final change I made was to limit the x-axis. Before there was a lot of empty space so the 'data/ink' ratio was pretty bad. There was a lot more plot space utilized 
here.  
Before the x-axis also only went from 15-14. I'm not sure why it was like this originally, however, I managed to label the entire x-axis and include accurate measurements.

'Bad' Plot

This plot represents a clustering method on different stony coral species. It was used to predict reactions to climate change by comparing current coral species to previous ancestors
This plot is complicated, but it actually isn't that bad. It conveys a lot of information, but that is necessary for this research. 
One way that I still think it could improve is the use of the time axis. I feel like it is a needless dimension. The time dimension is plotted in terms of length
where a small portion of the screen is equal to 60 MYr, lower right on the plot. I think that it isn't immediately useful. You either have to use a ruler of some kind
to measure the time or just eyeball it. The common ancestry already kind of implies time passing, so it might be better to just remove that variable int he first place
or include it in a separate and different plot.


Good Plot

This one shows the upper field limit for super conductors, which is the maximum magnetic field that can be applied to a specific substance to have it exhibit
super conducting properties. It plots this versus temperature. I like this plot because there isn't a lot of excess space used, it even includes the field limit for 0 
temp for one of the functions that goes off the screen. It uses color to show the differences between the plots for several spin-orbit coupled systems. I think it is effective
at conveying how the upper field limit depends on T and SOC.
